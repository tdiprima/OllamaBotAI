# Ollama Bot AI
A chatbot implementation that leverages Node.js and Python, providing a flexible alternative for developers.

### Running the Node.js Chatbot

To get started, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
node server.js
```

This will start the server. Next, open the `index.html` file in the `public` folder using Visual Studio Code, and you're ready to interact with the chatbot.

### Running the Python Script

Alternatively, you can use the Python script by running the following command:

```sh
streamlit run chatbot.py
```

This will launch a window in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501/, allowing you to interact with the chatbot.
